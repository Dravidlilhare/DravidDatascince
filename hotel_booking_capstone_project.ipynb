        "The hotel industry is a highly competitive and dynamic industry where demand and supply patterns constantly fluctuate. As such, hotel operators must be able to adapt and make informed decisions based on current market trends and customer behaviour. In this project, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted on a dataset of hotel bookings to gain insights into booking patterns, customer demographics and preferences, and the effectiveness of different distribution channels.\n",

        "The EDA conducted in this project revealed several key insights that can be used to inform business decisions. For instance, the analysis of booking patterns and cancellations can help operators adjust their pricing and cancellation policies to optimize revenue. The analysis of customer demographics and preferences can help operators tailor their marketing efforts to reach their target audience effectively. Additionally, the analysis of distribution channels can help operators identify which channels are most effective in generating bookings and allocate resources accordingly.\n",

What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel, and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data. Explore and analyse the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings."

From the chart, it can be seen that the prices of both hotels vary with respect to the months, and that the Resort hotel has a higher average daily rate than the City hotel throughout the year. The prices of both hotels show a general trend of increasing during the summer months and decreasing during the winter months. This could indicate that there is a seasonal pattern in hotel prices. The chart also shows that the City hotel's prices are more stable throughout the year compared to the Resort hotel's prices, which fluctuate more. Overall, the chart gives insight into the pricing strategy and trends of Resort and City hotels and can help businesses in the hospitality industry to make informed decisions."
